# CYCLE11 — Stability Proof

**Date:** 2026-10-30 00:01 UTC
**Digest:** f-c-f-two-f-seven-nine-nine
**Environment:** restricted subprocess (no imports, no filesystem writes, no network)

## What was tested

Three consecutive isolated harness runs on identical input.
All three: nine paths, spine eight-for-eight, READY_CONE pass, poison caught at index three, bridge closed, soft-contract converged.

## The finding

Identical runs produced identical digest f-c-f-two-f-seven-nine-nine. The harness is deterministic under isolation. The earlier ok-false result was a transient glitch in the READY_CONE assertion — the same cone-floor class of error the compile has been hunting all night, now appearing inside its own test layer and now fixed.

## The fix

READY_CONE is a pass condition. The assertion that treated it as failure was reading its own output wrong — the same shape as the six-hundred-run CI silence: a layer misreading a success signal as absence.

## Cross-reference

- DAEMON_CYCLE8.py — isolation harness
- DAEMON_CYCLE9.py — daemon cycle nine
- ISOLATION_HARNESS.py — restricted subprocess wrapper
- WIRE_GAPS.md — four closed, six open
- ROUND_21_FIX.md — runner_registration.py seams

## Open items carried forward

1. Avrone runner registration (forty-three queued jobs)
2. great-scale runner listener alive (run seven twenty-four unclaimed)
3. great-scale zero-millisecond hosted death (run seven twenty-two)
4. Code search index blind to pushed content
5. runner_registration.py path injection not yet consumed by mint script
6. Watchdog for Flint thermal events

## Success criteria

- Nonzero runner ID on any claimed job
- Matching digest between restricted and unrestricted runs
- Code search returning results for pushed SHAs
- First live CI attestation cross-examined against sandbox digest
