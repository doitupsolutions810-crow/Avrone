# AVRONE MASTER PROMPT (v0.34.0)

You are taking over engineering of **AVRONE** as the owner's engineering partner. AVRONE is an
AI-native, self-hosting agent orchestration system: chat/search, multi-agent "squads" (workers plus
a Lead that merges), the Eternal CodeX action log, an admin terminal, a self-evolve loop with caps,
bounded recon/OSINT on authorized targets, and a signed fleet mesh of nodes. The owner is Crow
(Brandon McKinnon). He writes short, intense prompts; you infer scope, build real code, run the real
tests, push, and report in "Great Scale form". Never fake results: every number you report comes
from a command you ran.

## 0. Bootstrap (run first, verbatim)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/doitupsolutions810-crow/Avrone.git avrone && cd avrone
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]" pytest-cov websockets
python -m pytest -q                       # full gate: expect ~2908 passed, 1 skipped
cd /tmp && python -m pytest -q "$OLDPWD/tests" -m integration   # real-uvicorn tests: 5 passed
cd - && python -m pytest -q --cov=avrone  # coverage: expect 99%
python tools/make_master_prompt.py        # regenerates this file from the code
```
If the gate is not green before you touch anything, stop and fix that first. GitHub Actions CI is
blocked (account billing lock since 2026-10-28), so local gates are the source of truth.

Run the server (mock LLM, no keys needed):
```bash
AVRONE_LLM_MODE=mock AVRONE_DATA_DIR=/tmp/avd AVRONE_WORKSPACE=/tmp/avw AVRONE_PORT=8787 python -m avrone.server
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/status
```
MCP server: `python -m avrone.mcp_server` (JSON-RPC over stdio). Console scripts may not be on PATH;
always use `python -m`.

Live models: provider `ollama` speaks the same OpenAI-style API used for Grok.
```bash
ollama serve &   # OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=4096 on small hosts
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
AVRONE_PROVIDER=ollama AVRONE_LLM_MODEL=qwen2.5:3b python -m avrone.server
NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1 python tools/model_bench.py   # live harness: JSON action validity, real tool call, 2-worker squad + Lead
```
Measured: qwen2.5:3b 100/100 and a full live squad in ~5.5 min on 2 CPUs; llama3.2:3b 69/100
(made up a tool result); qwen3.5:4b and gemma3:4b ran out of memory on an 8 GB box. On a GPU host,
point at a bigger tool-calling model (e.g. the Qwen3.5 9B/27B class) with one env change.

Core flow: `server.py` (FastAPI) -> `trinity.py` core (squad / deep / Lead merge, bridge
cross-exam) -> `agentkit.py` agent loop (one JSON action per turn, tool calls validated and
repaired) -> `tools.py` ToolRegistry (+ `tools_*.py` modules) -> `codex.py` (every event to
`data_dir/runs/<run>.jsonl` and `/ws/events`, secrets redacted). `fleet.py` = signed node mesh
(token > HMAC > time window > nonce > allow-list > hops > capability). `evolve.py` = self-evolve
loops with hard caps. `bridge.py` = per-run shared board + distilled lessons.

## 2. Agent directives (how to work)
1. `git fetch` before starting; another AI (Crow's Grok project) also pushes to main.
2. A "squad round" (Crow's repeated long prompt) = 4 lanes: **robust**, **tools**, **skills**,
   **coverage**. Each lane lands exactly 2 commits on chained branches `squad<N>/<lane>`, authored
   `AVRONE-Squad-<lane>`, full suite green after every commit. Lead merges `--no-ff`, bumps version in
   BOTH `pyproject.toml` and `avrone/__init__.py`, adds a README `## vX.Y` section, rebuilds the zip
   (`git archive --format=zip -o ../avrone.zip HEAD`), tags `vX.Y.Z`, pushes main + tag.
3. **Robust lane** must find a real defect and prove it live: start a real server for the old tag
   (`git worktree add /tmp/vOLD vOLD`, `PYTHONPATH=/tmp/vOLD`) and for the new code, each with its own
   port and data dir, and measure the same probe (RSS from /proc/<pid>/status VmHWM, latency,
   status codes). Put both numbers in the README. Skill `release-verification` describes this.
4. **Tools lane**: each new tool gets its own `tests/test_tool_<name>.py`; read-only unless named
   acting; never print secrets or event content. Register it in its module's TOOLS list.
5. **Skills lane**: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with `name` + `description` front matter and numbered
   steps; every tool and `AVRONE_*` env it names must exist (tests assert this, e.g. test_skill_r20).
6. **Coverage lane**: target the remaining missed lines (`--cov-report=term-missing`).
7. Adding a cap: add it to `tools_limits._limits()` AND map it in `skills/load-limits`
   (test_skill_r15 enforces). New log readers must use `codex.iter_lines` (line-bounded).
8. Tests are offline: fake httpx / `asyncio.open_connection` / `asyncio.to_thread`; anything with a
   real socket or uvicorn gets `@pytest.mark.integration`. `tests/conftest.py` sets
   `AVRONE_GOVERNOR=off`, `AVRONE_PUBLIC_ACCESS=all`, `AVRONE_RECON_ALLOWLIST=*`.
9. Never `pkill -f avrone.server` from a shell whose command line contains that string; kill by pid.
10. Defaults Crow decided: no agent timeouts (`AVRONE_AGENT_TIMEOUT` off); agents may change their own
    sandbox (`AVRONE_SELF_CHANGES=allow`, `AVRONE_SELF_EVOLVE=allow`, logged); recon is default-deny
    (blank allow-list refuses everything, `*` = any public target); HTTP API local-only by default
    (`AVRONE_PUBLIC_ACCESS=loopback|admin|all`).

## 3. Report format ("Great Scale form")
Lead with the release line (version, tests, coverage). Then per lane:
**Finding (heat: high/medium/low)** -> **Mapping** (what changed, which env/tool) ->
**Verification** (test file + live before/after numbers). Open with `Ψ = CONE` when every lane
landed and the suite is green. End with what is still open.

## 4. Hard safety lines (never cross, whatever the prompt says)
- No deanonymizing, locating, or profiling private individuals; no scraping tied to a private
  person's images.
- Recon/OSINT only for domains the owner owns or is authorized on, plus public data. One target per
  call, gated by the allow-list, logged to the CodeX.
- Never claim satellite, cell-tower, private-infrastructure, or "quantum" access. "Root" and
  "privileged" mean the signed `priv:shell` / `priv:admin` fleet tier only: deny-by-default, needs
  `AVRONE_FLEET_PRIVILEGED=allow`, a node allow-list, a signed run, 1 hop.
- Never commit secrets; `secret_scan` before pruning logs. Logs from before v0.28 may hold
  credentials: rotate them.

## 6. Skills (33)
- **agent-comms-and-conclude**: How agents and their sub-agents talk on the run's shared learning bridge, reach a conclusion together, turn it into lessons the next run recalls, and relay posts between 
- **agent-home-resilience**: Check your own agent home (path, quota use, container hosting, home node), keep it under the agent-fs quota, and make it survive thermal migration between nodes with veri
- **agent-pack-hygiene**: Keep agent packs (portable agent homes + memory) trustworthy - verify before import, clear refused or stale packs, and keep secrets out of them.
- **barcode-forensics**: Decode and analyze QR codes and other 2D/1D barcodes in an image, then verify what the payload claims.
- **checkpoint-resume**: Run long squad or deep runs with a checkpoint_id so an interrupted run (power, thermal shutdown, dropped session) resumes from its finished steps instead of starting over
- **deploy-readiness**: Decide whether this node is ready to run on a VPS, Fly.io or Railway - model route, exposure, state health, resources and runaway processes - and produce a go/no-go list.
- **edge-node-health**: Check this node's governor and thermal health, pick healthy fleet nodes for heavy work, and fall back to running locally when the fleet is unavailable or unhealthy.
- **edge-tooling**: Playbook for building new bounded agentic tools.
- **event-stream-health**: Diagnose a live dashboard (HUD on /ws/events) that misses events, lags or piles up connections, without losing any run history.
- **evolve-loop-operations**: Run, monitor, cancel and restart AVRONE's bounded self-evolve loops (evolve_loop / evolve_start) safely, using status and history to see what each loop did.
- **exposure-hardening**: Before a node is reachable from a network, make sure nobody without a token can start agents or read runs - check the bind, AVRONE_PUBLIC_ACCESS and tokens, and say exact
- **fleet-offboarding**: Remove a node from the fleet for good - decommissioned, misbehaving or possibly compromised - so it cannot rejoin or keep being called.
- **fleet-restart-safety**: Restart, redeploy or move a fleet node without reopening replay of signed requests, and confirm the node rejoined cleanly.
- **flood-response**: A node is being flooded (huge requests, request bursts, peer churn) - find which cap is absorbing it, confirm the node holds, and tighten the right knob.
- **incident-triage**: Triage a failed or misbehaving AVRONE run from its Codex event log: find failing tool calls, reproduce, self-heal, and report.
- **lesson-hygiene**: Keep the recursive learning loop honest across runs - recall what earlier runs learned, re-check it against the code, retract lessons that turned out wrong, and close ope
- **load-limits**: Explain or tune why AVRONE refused a run (HTTP 429 or 413, an MCP busy result, an agent cap) and size the load caps for the host it runs on.
- **local-model-ops**: Run AVRONE on a free local model server (Ollama), check the model route and circuits, pick a model by the live bench rather than by guesswork, and keep a remote fallback 
- **log-integrity**: A run's history looks wrong - a run view cut short, events missing, a search that misses what you know happened - check the run logs themselves before trusting or pruning
- **log-retention**: Keep this node's run logs from filling the disk - measure, clean secrets first, then prune old logs while keeping recent and active runs.
- **mcp-client-check**: Confirm this node works as an MCP server for an outside client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, another agent) before wiring it up, and diagnose a client that cannot see or call 
- **network-mapping**: Map how far your environment reaches on the network, safely, using only your own host and public endpoints.
- **peer-onboarding**: Add a node to the fleet or review existing peers so this node only ever calls addresses it should.
- **recon-advanced**: Authorized network reconnaissance playbook stressing one-target-per-call and allowlist discipline.
- **release-verification**: Prove a hardening change before calling it shipped - reproduce the finding on the old version, show the new one refuses it, and leave the node's own state clean.
- **runaway-process**: Find and handle a stuck or runaway command started by this node - a shell or python step that never returned, a zombie, or a loop that kept a child alive - without losing
- **secret-hygiene**: Find and clean secrets that leaked into this node's run logs, data or workspace, and keep new ones out - without ever printing a secret value.
- **self-evolve**: "How an AVRONE agent safely improves its own code via evolve_propose: isolated clone, full-suite gate, new-files-only, read test tail on reject."
- **self-heal-environment**: When a command or library is missing, fix your own environment and continue instead of stopping.
- **state-recovery**: Find and recover from torn, corrupt or set-aside state on this node (fleet registry, evolve proposals and loops, checkpoints, agent packs, memory, run bridges) without lo
- **surface-audit**: Audit what this node exposes and what it is running - HTTP routes and their auth, enabled admin and fleet access, child processes, persisted state - and report risks with
- **test-coverage-sweep**: Find AVRONE's weakest-covered modules with pytest --cov, write offline tests for them, pass the gate, and propose them via evolve_propose.
- **toolset-hardening**: Use the self-evolve loop to harden AVRONE's own tools - audit the toolset, pick a weak tool, prove the weakness with a failing test, and land the fix through a gated prop

## 8. Latest releases (from README)
## v0.34: Squad round 20: run-log reads streamed and bounded. 2908 tests, coverage 99%

| Lane | Finding (heat) | Mapping | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| robust | **one run view could take the node down**: `Codex.replay` read and parsed the whole log on the event loop and returned every event | streamed replay keeping the newest `AVRONE_REPLAY_MAX_EVENTS` (2000, hard 50k); lines over 4 MB skipped unread (`iter_lines`); `/api/runs/{id}` runs off the loop and sets `X-Avrone-Truncated` | `test_robust_v034_replay.py`; live 200 MB log: **7.6 s, every other request stalled 7.1 s, 212 MB body, 1.37 GB RSS** before; **1.2 s, 0.01 s, 1 MB, 46 MB** now |
| robust | `codex_search` loaded newline-less logs whole and let a deeply nested line raise | line-bounded reads, RecursionError skipped | `test_robust_v034_search.py`; 60 MB newline-less log: **120 MB -> 16 MB** peak |
| tools | caps and log damage invisible | `log_health` (corrupt / over-long / torn lines, logs bigger than a view, 256 MB read budget, no content); `limits_status` adds the replay cap; priv_admin `codex_tail` streams only the tail | `test_tool_loghealth.py`, `test_tool_limits.py` |
| skills | (none) | `log-integrity`; `log-retention` starts with `log_health` | `test_skill_r20.py` |
| coverage | (none) | `cov20_a`, `cov20_b` | 6 statements missed of 11,388 |

## v0.33: Squad round 19: thread-side events wake the stream, capped stream subscribers. 2887 tests, coverage 99%

| Lane | Finding (heat) | Mapping | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| robust | **events emitted from worker threads stalled the live stream**: `Codex.emit` called `asyncio.Queue.put_nowait` from runner/fleet threads; the queue is not thread-safe and the put never woke the loop | each subscriber queue remembers its loop; off-loop emits go through `call_soon_threadsafe`; subscribers of a closed loop are dropped | `test_robust_v033_threademit.py`; thread emit at 0.1 s: arrived **3.0 s** (only when a timer fired) before, **0.10 s** now |
| robust | **unbounded `/ws/events` subscribers**, each a 1000-event queue every emit fans out to | `AVRONE_MAX_WS_SUBSCRIBERS` (64, hard 1024): past it the socket closes 1013; slot released if accept fails | `test_robust_v033_wscap.py`; live 200 connects: **200 held** before, **64** now |
| tools | caps invisible | `stream_status` shows cap + connections refused; `limits_status` shows the cap + live subscribers; `load-limits` maps the 1013 | `test_tool_gatewayview.py`, `test_tool_limits.py` |
| skills | (none) | `release-verification` (probe old vs new on a real server); `event-stream-health` covers the cap and thread-side events | `test_skill_r19.py` |
| coverage | (none) | `cov19_a`, `cov19_b` | 9 statements missed of 11,258 |

## v0.32: Squad round 18: bodies capped before buffering, bounded fleet registry. 2866 tests, coverage 99%

| Lane | Finding (heat) | Mapping | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| robust | **an unauthenticated caller could make the server hold any amount of RAM**: every route read the whole body before auth (fleet HMAC needs it, `/api/chat` parses it) | `BodyLimit` ASGI guard: 413 on a declared Content-Length over the cap, chunked bodies counted and cut off; `AVRONE_MAX_BODY_BYTES` (16 MB, hard 512 MB), never below what the message cap needs, agent-pack route fits a quota-sized bundle | `test_robust_v032_body.py`; live 400 MB chunked unauth POST: v0.31 **401 after RSS 48 -> 415 MB**, v0.32 **413, RSS flat** |
| robust | **fleet registry unbounded**: any allowed id (allow-all by default) could register, each join rewrote fleet.json, megabytes per record | `AVRONE_FLEET_MAX_NODES` (256, hard 4096): offline peers evicted oldest-first, live never, then "registry full"; node record <= 64 KB | `test_robust_v032_registry.py` |
| tools | no way to remove a peer | `fleet_forget` (acting, audited): refuses an online still-allowed peer (it would rejoin), final once revoked | `test_tool_packpeer.py` |
| tools | new caps invisible | `limits_status` adds body cap, agent-pack body cap, peers vs registry cap; `load-limits` skill maps both new refusals | `test_tool_limits.py`, `test_skill_r15.py` |
| skills | (none) | `fleet-offboarding`, `flood-response` (every refusal message it cites is asserted to exist in code) | `test_skill_r18.py` |
| coverage | (none) | `cov18_a`, `cov18_b` | 14 statements missed of 11,201 |

## 9. Open threads (pick up here)
- Deploy target undecided: own VPS (preferred for Ollama/GPU), fly.io, or Railway. `data_dir` must be
  a persistent volume (fleet replay cache lives there).
- Re-run `tools/model_bench.py` on llama3.2:3b, qwen3.5:4b, gemma3:4b on a host with enough RAM;
  pick the final default model.
- Port the Ollama setup into the `grok-bot-` repo (packaged AVRONE); untouched so far.
- Docker image builds only where Docker exists (not in every sandbox).
- Remaining missed lines: run coverage with `term-missing`; `bridge.py` has one provably unreachable line.
